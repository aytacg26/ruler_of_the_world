##### The Ruler of the World is a Card Collection Game which will be played by five main players and possible number of game breakers,

There are 208 + 1 countries in the world and game will have a maximum of 5 main players and a possible number of game breakers which will be named
as pirates of the game but at the end of the game there will be only one **"Ruler of the World"**.

### - Main Players
First five player who collects at least 12 Country Cards will be main players of the game and main players will fight
against each other and also game breakers to get the unique and rare **"Ruler of the World"** card. When a player collects
at least 12 Country Cards, we will transfer a Main Player Card to his/her wallet. All players should follow the rules and
create their strategies to be the winner of the game and to get the **"Ruler of the World"** card.


### - Game Breakers (Priates of the Game)
After the announcement of 5 main players (first five player), any other player who collects the cards and breaks the possible
strategies of the main players will be accepted as Priates and for game breakers or priates, we will transfer a Priate Card
to their wallets. For some strategies or points, main players should collect the required country cards, for example, to
get the **EU Card** a main player should collect from the limited number of EU Countries cards, but before collecting
those limited number of cards, they can be hostaged by a priate or more priates and hence priate(s) will break the strategy 
of the main player. These cases will create the trade or negotiation part of the game. A main player will need to negotiate
with priates to get required cards for his/her strategy.

### - About Game

Game will be a fight between 5 main players and possible number of game breakers (priates). The Ruler of the World game
will take 15 months starting from the date of publish of collection cards and in this time period, each month we will
publish an amount of country cards and power cards. Each month, 5 hours before publishing the cards, we will announce
the list of countries and changes on the cards at our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/joefunnyfrog), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/JoetheFunnyFrog) and website of [The Ruler of the World](https://www.rownft.art). 
The website of **The Ruler of the World** will be published in February 2022. At the end of the period of the game, the one main
player who collects the most amount of country cards and the highest point will be the winner or **The Ruler of the World** and
she/he will get the unique and rare **The Ruler of the World** card. At the end of the game, only one player will be able to collect
208 + 1 country cards, another one player will be able to collect 200 of the cards and remaining three players will be able to collect
195 of the cards. Apart from country cards, each player will have power cards and some other multiplier cards which we will explain in 
the following sections. Each player should follow the rules and any disobey to any rule will cost 10 points to the player and if she/he
disobey more than 2 rules, she/he will be eliminated from the game and his/her points will be split equally between other main players.

Collecting all countries will give the highest point to the player but it won't be enough to be **The Ruler of the World**. One may collect
less amount of country cards and power cards and hence may have the highest amount of the points. For this reason, each player should
evaluate his/her strategy carefully.

Each country will have points according to their global power index (this will be given in the Countries List) and main determination will
depend on the economic power. The ones who has more economic power will be able to collect more powerful countries and hence they will receive
a Economic Power Card to their wallets. Apart from Economic Power Card, which will add 10 points to the total points of the players, there will
be other 6 type of Power cards and under each type of Power Card, there will be additional cards which will have different points and which
will effect the multiplier on the main Power Card (Main Power Cards will be trasferred to the wallet of the main players and according to
the collected sub-types, each main player will have different multiplier number on their main Power Cards and this multiplier will effect
the total points of the main player.)

To increase the points, main players will need to have as much country as possible and also as much power cards as possible according to
their point strategy. With a good strategy, one may get the **The Ruler of the World** card and be the winner of the game without holding
all country cards but in any case, some of the country cards will be unique and rare, some of them will be less than five. The maximum
number of country cards will be five and maximum number of Power Cards will be less than five. At the end of each month, points of main
players will be published at the website of **The Ruler of the World** and also the list of priates will be given on the same site.

### - Power Cards
There will be six different type of power cards and these cards will effect the points of the main players. The main Power Cards can be
listed as follows :

##### 1 - Technology Cards
##### 2 - Energy Cards
##### 3 - Military Force Cards
##### 4 - Major Straits Cards
##### 5 - EU Card
##### 6 - NATO Card
