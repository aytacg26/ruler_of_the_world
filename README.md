##### The Ruler of the World is a Card Collection Game which will be played by five main players and possible number of game breakers,

There are 208 + 1 countries in the world and game will have a maximum of 5 main players and a possible number of game breakers which will be named
as pirates of the game but at the end of the game there will be only one **"Ruler of the World"**.

### - Main Players (A Player or a team of maxiumum 20)
First five player who collects at least 12 Country Cards will be main players of the game and main players will fight
against each other and also game breakers to get the unique and rare **"The Ruler of the World"** card. When a player collects
at least 12 Country Cards, we will transfer a Main Player Card to his/her wallet. All players should follow the rules and
create their strategies to be the winner of the game and to get the **"The Ruler of the World"** card.


### - Game Breakers (Pirates of the Game)
After the announcement of 5 main players (first five player or first five team), any other player who collects the cards and breaks the possible
strategies of the main players will be accepted as Pirates and for game breakers or pirates, we will transfer a Pirate Card
to their wallets. For some strategies or points, main players should collect the required country cards, for example, to
get the **EU Card** a main player should collect from the limited number of EU Countries cards, but before collecting
those limited number of cards, they can be hostaged by a pirate or more priates and hence pirate(s) will break the strategy 
of the main player. These cases will create the trade or negotiation part of the game. A main player will need to negotiate
with pirates to get required cards for his/her strategy.

### - About Game

Game will be a fight between 5 main players and possible number of game breakers (pirates). The Ruler of the World game
will take 15 months starting from the date of publish of collection cards and in this time period, each month we will
publish an amount of country cards and power cards. Each month, 5 hours before publishing the cards, we will announce
the list of countries and changes on the cards at our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/joefunnyfrog), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/JoetheFunnyFrog) and website of [The Ruler of the World](https://www.rownft.art). 
The website of **The Ruler of the World** will be published in February 2022. At the end of the period of the game, the one main
player who collects the most amount of country cards and the highest point will be the winner or **The Ruler of the World** and
she/he will get the unique and rare **The Ruler of the World** card. At the end of the game, only one player will be able to collect
208 + 1 country cards, another one player will be able to collect 200 of the cards and remaining three players will be able to collect
195 of the cards. Apart from country cards, each player will have power cards and some other multiplier cards which we will explain in 
the following sections. Each player should follow the rules and any disobey to any rule will cost 10 points to the player and if she/he
disobey more than 2 rules, she/he will be eliminated from the game and his/her points will be split equally between other main players.

Collecting all countries will give the highest point to the player or player team but it won't be enough to be **The Ruler of the World**. One may collect
less amount of country cards and power cards and hence may have the highest amount of the points. For this reason, each player should
evaluate his/her strategy carefully.

Each country will have points according to their global power index (this will be given in the Countries List) and main determination will
depend on the economic power. The ones who has more economic power will be able to collect more powerful countries and hence they will receive
a Economic Power Card to their wallets. Apart from Economic Power Card, which will add 10 points to the total points of the players, there will
be other 6 type of Power cards and under each type of Power Card, there will be additional cards which will have different points and which
will effect the multiplier on the main Power Card (Main Power Cards will be trasferred to the wallet of the main players and according to
the collected sub-types, each main player will have different multiplier number on their main Power Cards and this multiplier will effect
the total points of the main player.)

To increase the points, main players will need to have as much country as possible and also as much power cards as possible according to
their point strategy. With a good strategy, one may get the **The Ruler of the World** card and be the winner of the game without holding
all country cards but in any case, some of the country cards will be unique and rare, some of them will be less than five. The maximum
number of country cards will be five and maximum number of Power Cards will be less than five. At the end of each month, points of main
players will be published at the website of **The Ruler of the World** and also the list of priates will be given on the same site.

### - Power Cards
There will be six different type of power cards and these cards will effect the points of the main players. The main Power Cards can be
listed as follows :

##### 1 - Technology Cards
##### 2 - Energy Cards
##### 3 - Military Force Cards
##### 4 - Major Straits Cards
##### 5 - EU Card
##### 6 - NATO Card

&nbsp;

## 1- Technology Cards

Only one technology card will be published from each type of technology and the ones who holds more will be technologically powerful and will get Technology Power Card (this will be transferred to the wallet of the player), there will be 4 different technology cards and maximum 4 player will be able to get Technology Power Card. One player may hold all by collecting them immediately after publishing them or 4 will be split between 4 of 5 players. Depending on the number of technology cards, Player will get a Technology Power Card with a multiplier of  NTC/4 (NTC => Number of Technology Cards). This multiplier will effect points on cards which needs Technology Power Card.
&nbsp;
### Main Technology Cards
        1- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology Card
        2- Quantum Computing Technology Card
        3- 5G Data Technology Card
        4- Cyber Security Technology Card

## Calculation Example :
If a player has the China, India, United States and Australia Cards, and also Coal Energy Card, total Coal Energy of the player will be 5619.9M tonnes per year , on the other hand WTCP is 7109.7M tonnes per year and hence EM35 multiplier of the player will be 0.5, the additional point for the Energy Power of the player will be 0.5 x 6 = 3 points and total point will be Technology Power Card Multiplier x 8point + 6point + 3points


## 3- Military Force Cards

Each country will have a point and each point also shows the power index of that country. There will be three types of Military Force Cards and each card will have a multiplier which will create the Military Force power of the player. On the other hand Energy Power Card of each player will effect the total Military Force power of the player. Each player who has energy cards, will have a Energy Power Card and this will be transferred to the wallet of the player after collection of the Energy Cards. According to the points from Energy Cards, Energy Power Card of the player will have a multiplier on it and this will add additional point to the Military Force Power Card of the player. 

Maximum Total Energy Point of a Player will be calculated from EM35 lists and effect on Military Force Power Card point will be calculated from the base total points of the Energy Cards. From the energy cards, it is known that there will be 6 different energy card (3 from Renewable Energy Cards (wind, solar and biodiesel) and 3 from Non-renewable Energy Cards (Petroleum, Natural Gas, Coal)), for each energy card, base points are given below

	Energy Card					        Base Point
	Renewable Wind Energy Card		 	    	5
	Renewable Solar Energy Card			    	8
	Biodiesel Energy Card				    	15
	Petroleum Energy Card				    	18
	Natural Gas Energy Card			        	15
	Coal Energy Card				        6

###	Total Base Point of Energy Cards	: 	67

if a player has a total of 100 Points from his/her Energy Cards, his/her Energy Power Card multiplier will be 100/67 = 1.49

A Complete Calculation example for Military Force Power Card of the player will be given after the presentation of Military Force Cards. As it is mention above, there will be three types of Military Force Cards, these are

#####	1 -  Air Forces Card
#####	2 –  Land Forces Card
#####	3 –  Naval Forces Card

---

### 3.1. Air Forces Card

This will give air force power to the player. Only 3 Air Force Card (1 Card with 3 copies) will be published and it will have a multiplier of 2 on total power indexes of the country cards that player holds. This multiplier will be added on to the other Military Force Card multipliers.  If a player has 20 countries and total power index of those countries is 15, total point from this card will increase to 30 and if the player has an Energy Power Card multiplier of 1.49, total point of player from all these cards will be  44.7 points.

This point contains Country Points, Effect of Technology Cards, Effect of Energy Power Cards plus effect of Air Forces Card. Complete Calculation will be given at the end of all Military Force Card explanations and it will contain detailed calculations

---
### 3.2. Land Forces Card
This will give land force power to the player. Only 4 Land Force Card will be published (1 Card with 4 copies) and it will have a multiplier of 1.6 on total power indexes of the country cards that player holds. This multiplier will be added on to the other Military Force Card multipliers. If a player has Air Force Card, total Military Force multiplier will be 3.6 (2 from Air Force Card and 1.6 from Land Forces Card). In this case, if a player has 20 countries and total power index of those countries is 15, total point from Military Force Card multipliers will be 3.6 x 15 =  54 and if the player has an Energy Power Card multiplier of 1.49, total point of player from all these cards will be 80.46.

---
### 3.3. Naval Forces Card
This will give naval force power to the player. Only 3 Naval Force Card will be published (1 Card with 3 Copies) and it will have a multiplier of 1.8 on total power indexes of the country cards that player holds. This multiplier will be added on to the other Military Force multipliers. If a player has all three Military Force Cards (Air Forces Card, Land Forces Card and Naval Forces Card), she or he will have a total military force multiplier of 5.4 (2 from Air Force Card, 1.6 from Land Forces Card and 1.8 from Naval Forces Card). In this case, if a player has 20 countries and total power index of those countries is 15, total point from Military Force Card multipliers will be 5.4 x 15 =  81 and if the player has an Energy Power Card multiplier of 1.49, total point of player from all these cards will be 120.69


### Detailed Point Calculation Example :
We will assume that one player has the following country cards (Power Index Points of all countries will be given in a separate list)


	Country		Card Point (Power Index)	
	1- Canada		1.28
	2- Brazil		1.59
	3- Mexico		1.16
	4- Libya		1.08
	5- China		2.96
	6- Nigeria		1.17
	7- Germany		1.43
	8- Japan		1.84
	9- Vietnam		1.22
	10-Malaysia		1.14

Player has 10 countries and total power index of cards is 14.87

Apart from Countries, player achieved to get 2 of the technology cards, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Technology Card and 5G Data Technology Card. In this case, Technology Power Card multiplier of the player will be 2/4 that is 0.5

From Energy Cards, we assume that the player achieved to get Natural Gas Card and Coal Gas Card, from EM35 List of each card, the Energy Power of the player will be calculated as follows :

Natural Gas Card total 531 cubic km/year, WTNGP is 3948.24 cubic km/year and hence EM35 multiplier of the player from Natural Gas Card will be 0.1344 and hence additional point for the Energy Power of the player will be 0.1344 x 15 = 2.016 points and total point will be 0.5 x 14 + 15 + 2.016 = 24.016 points

Coal Gas Card total 4410.3M tonnes per year, WTCP is 7109.7M tonnes per year and hence EM35 multiplier of the player will be 0.62 and additional point for the Energy Power of the player will be 0.62 x 6 = 3.72 points and total point will be 0.5 x 8 + 6 + 3.72 = 13.72 points

In this case, total Energy Power Point of the player will be 37.736 and we know that Total Base Point of the Energy Cards is 67. At this point, Energy Power Card multiplier of the player will be 0.563

Same player achieve to collect Land Forces and Naval Forces cards from Military Force Cards. At this point, we will be able to calculate total points of the player without considering points from “Major Straits Cards”, “EU Card” and “NATO Card”. These cards will add additional points to the player under some conditions which we will describe in following sections.

#### Total Point Of Player Up to This Point : 
	
		Land Forces Multiplier = 1.6
		Naval Forces Multiplier = 1.8
		Total Military Force Multiplier of Player = 3.4
		Total Energy Power Multiplier of Player = 0.563
		Total Power Index from Country Cards = 14.87

Total Points of the Player = 3.4 x 0.563 x 14.87 = 28.46 Points (This player does not have enough Energy Power to use in Military Forces against competitors (other main players))


## 4- Major Straits Cards

A Strait is a narrow channel of the sea joining two larger bodies of water. It most commonly refers to a channel of water that lies between two land masses. Strait is used for international navigation through the territorial sea between one part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of high seas or an exclusive economic zone are subject to the legal regime of transit passage. Straits are commercially and strategically important for **The Ruler of the World**. Importance of Straits came from the following 

	1- Seaborne trade for commercial shipping
	2 – Vital oil producing region
	3 – Play vital role in geo-politics

There will be 18 Major Straits Cards and each card will multiply the point of the location country points by a multiplier of that Strait. That is, if a player holds for example Bosporus Strait, it will effect the point of location country, that is point of Turkey. Base point of Turkey Card is 1.51 and multiplier of Bosporus Strait Card is 1.5, in this case, point from Turkey with Bosporus Strait Card will be 2.265. Each Major Strait and their multiplier is given in the following list

Note : Multiplier of Strait will effect point of each location country

#### Major Strait Cards, Location Countries and Multiplier of Card :
	Strait Card Name		Location Country or Countries		    Multiplier 	
	1- Malacca Strait		Indonesia – Malaysia				2.14			
	2- Palk Strait			India – Sri Lanka				1.85
	3- Yucatan Strait		Mexico – Cuba					1.89
	4-  Oranto Strait		Italy – Albania					1.86
	5- Mozambique Strait		Mozambique – Madagascar				1.68
	6- Bosporus Strait		Turkey						2.95
	7- Bab-el-Mandeb Strait		Yemen – Djibouti				2.65
	8- Cook Strait			New Zealand					1.75
	9- Taurus Strait		Papua New Guinea – Australia			1.92
	10 – Dover Strait		England – France				1.88
	11 – Florida Strait		USA – Cuba					1.85
	12 – Hormuz Strait		Oman – Iran					2.85
	13 – Hudson Strait		Canada						1.85
	14 – Gibraltar Strait		Spain – Morocco					2.95
	15 – Tsungaru Strait		Japan						1.83
	16 – Tatar Strait		Russia						1.82
	17 – Formosa Strait		China – Taiwan					1.84
	18 – Suez Canal			Egypt						2.95

Note : If two straits contains same country, point of that country will be multiplied by both straits. The only straits that has same location are Yucatan Strait and Florida Strait. In this case, if a player holds both Strait Cards and also Cuba Country Card, the point of Cuba will be calculated as

	Total Point of Cuba Country Card = Base Point of Cuba x Multiplier of Yucatan Strait x Multiplier of Florida Strait 
	
#### With Yucatan Strait Card and Florida Strait Card, total point of Cuba Card will be 1.08 x 1.89 x 1.85 = 3.776


## 5- EU Card

This list shows EU Countries, point of country and additional point from EU Card. To get additional point, player should collect all EU Countries and should hold EU Card (EU Card will be transferred to the wallet of the main player whenever she/he/they collect all EU country cards and only 3 of 5 main players will be able to collect all EU Country cards.
